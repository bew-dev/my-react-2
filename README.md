## About

This is a react boiler-plate that uses webpack, and webpack-dev-server so .  It
contains a decent webpack.config.js starter, and some basic layout components/
pages, that follow a pretty good pattern.  

Use this when you want to spin up react to test or learn React, or if you want
a quick boiler place for a new app.   

## Instructions to run
1. Navigate to folder */*
2. *NPM install*
3. On *webpack.config.js* configure the *host:* to *localhost* if your developing
   local, or else use your hostname if across the network.  
4. *NPM run dev*
5. Navigate to *localhost:3001*, or the hostname that you adjusted to.
